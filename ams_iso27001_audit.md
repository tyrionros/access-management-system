# ISO 27001:2022 Compliance Audit for Access Management System

## 1. Purpose

This document provides a detailed mapping of the Access Management System (AMS) features and artifacts to the relevant controls within the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A. It serves as evidence to demonstrate how the system's design and implementation support the organization's Information Security Management System (ISMS) and compliance requirements.

## 2. Scope

The scope of this audit mapping is limited to the functionalities of the custom-built Access Management System on the Power Platform. It assumes that the underlying platform (Microsoft Power Platform, Azure, and Azure Active Directory) has its own compliance and security controls that the AMS inherits.

## 3. Annex A Control Mapping

The following table details how the AMS project addresses specific ISO 27001:2022 controls.

| Control (Annex A) | Control Objective                                         | How the AMS Project Provides Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Gaps & Recommendations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **A.5.15**        | **Access Control**                                        | The organization's rules for controlling physical and logical access to information should be established and implemented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The entire AMS is a technical implementation of a formal access control policy. It enforces a standardized process for granting access, ensuring it is not done on an ad-hoc basis. **Evidence:** The existence and use of the system itself.                                           | None. The system directly addresses this control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **A.5.16**        | **Identity Management**                                   | The full lifecycle of identities should be managed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | The AMS leverages the corporate identity provider (Azure Active Directory) as the single source of truth for identities. The AMS does not create users; it assigns rights to existing, managed identities. **Evidence:** The User table in Dataverse is synchronized with Azure AD.    | The process for creating/disabling identities in Azure AD is out of scope for the AMS but must be documented as part of the overall ISMS.                                                                                                                                        |
| **A.5.17**        | **Authentication Information**                            | The allocation and management of authentication information (e.g., passwords, keys) should be controlled by a formal process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Authentication is handled by the underlying Power Platform, which relies on Azure AD. The AMS does not store or manage any passwords. This inherits strong authentication controls like MFA, password policies, and conditional access. **Evidence:** Platform architecture.             | None. Deferring to the platform is a security best practice.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **A.5.18**        | **Access Rights**                                         | The allocation and use of access rights should be restricted and controlled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | This is the core function of the AMS. <br/>- **Provisioning:** Access is granted only after a formal request and approval, logged by the system. **Evidence:** `ams_power_automate.md`, Access Request records. <br/>- **Review:** See Gaps. <br/>- **Revocation:** See Gaps. | **GAP:** The current design does not include a process for **periodic access reviews** (e.g., quarterly manager reviews). <br/>**GAP:** The design lacks a formal, automated process for **revoking access** for leavers. <br/>**Recommendation:** Add features to support both. |
| **A.8.2**         | **Privileged Access Rights**                              | The allocation and use of privileged access rights should be restricted and monitored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The `ams_security_roles.md` document explicitly defines the "Access Administrator" and "System Administrator" roles, which are privileged. Their permissions are clearly documented. **Evidence:** `ams_security_roles.md`, Dataverse Audit Logs.                                        | Ensure Dataverse auditing is enabled for all AMS entities, especially for changes to privileged user assignments and security roles.                                                                                                                                                |
| **A.8.3**         | **Information Access Restriction**                        | Access to information and other associated assets should be restricted in accordance with the established topic-specific policy on access control.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The AMS enforces the principle of least privilege. Users can only request roles from a pre-defined catalog, and the `ams_security_roles.md` document defines the exact permissions for each role. **Evidence:** `ams_access_catalog.md`, `ams_security_roles.md`.                      | None. The system's design is fully aligned with this control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## 4. Summary and Recommendations

The Access Management System provides a strong foundation for complying with the access control requirements of ISO 27001:2022. It successfully formalizes and automates the process for provisioning and managing access rights.

To fully meet the standard and achieve best practice, the following capabilities should be added to the project's scope:

1.  **Periodic Access Reviews:**
    *   **Requirement:** A process where managers or application owners must periodically review and re-certify who has access to their systems.
    *   **Implementation:** Create a new feature in the AMS to automatically generate quarterly review tasks for managers, asking them to approve or revoke the access of their direct reports.

2.  **Automated Leaver Process (Access Revocation):**
    *   **Requirement:** A timely process to ensure all access is removed when a user leaves the organization.
    *   **Implementation:** Create a Power Automate flow triggered by the HR system or when a user account is disabled in Azure AD. This flow should automatically initiate the process to revoke all access rights granted through the AMS.

By implementing these two recommendations, the AMS will provide comprehensive, end-to-end evidence for the entire access rights lifecycle (A.5.18), making your ISO 27001 audits significantly smoother.
